## **Testing** ##
We use Ponicode for testing based on AI. To use Ponicode, you must include 
"import fetch from "node-fetch";" in utils.ts. The import is commented out as default, bacause the project will not build with node-fetch imported. To test methods with Ponicode, press "Ponicode: Unit test" over the method signature. Then you can test the method with input and expected output. The test is then auto generated by Ponicode. Ponicode can also suggest tests with input and expected output for simple methods.
